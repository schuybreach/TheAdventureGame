The Adventure Game!
------------------------

Hello there!

This was a fun little personal project I made way back in 2015. 

It was the first personal project (and anything with some scale) that involved coding of any sort.

Matlab was the first programming language I ever learned and as this was my first "big" programming project. The back-end code is not pretty, like at all. Please don't hate.

For me though, this project was so much fun at the time, and what really helped me decide to switch majors to software engineering (from aeronautical engineering). 

After replaying it all these years later, I have noticed sooo many typos. Please ignore them. 

Let's not talk about the UI at all. 

For the game itself, there are three (3) ways (paths) to win. Also included is a hand drawn / computer painted map I made for visual purposes. There are also some additional .m files of little animations and other things not shown in the game, but are in the source code.

Run the "The_Adventure_Game.m" file (from within Matlab) to play.

That is all for now. Enjoy!
